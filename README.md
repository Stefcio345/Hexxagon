# HEXXAGON Game in C++

This is my implementation of classic strategy game "HEXXAGON", written in C++. This repository contains the source code for the game.

## About HEXXAGON
HEXXAGON is a turn-based game that is played on a hexagonal grid. The objective of the game is to have more of your pieces (hexagons) on the board than your opponent's when the game ends. You can achieve this by strategically moving and jumping your pieces to convert your opponent's hexagons into your own.

Key features of this HEXXAGON implementation include:

Intuitive user interface (UI) for playing the game.
Support for single-player and two-player modes.
An AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.
A clean and intuitive user interface.


## Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of HEXXAGON up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
To build and run HEXXAGON, you'll need the following:

Windows OS

### Building

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```git
git clone https://github.com/Stefcio345/Hexxagon
```

Change into the project directory:
```bash
cd Hexxagon
```

Run the game:
```bash
./run.ps1
```

## How to Play
Start the game and select the game mode (single-player or two-player).

In single-player mode, you can choose the difficulty level of the AI opponent.

The game board will be displayed with hexagonal tiles.

Players take turns to move their pieces. Move your cursor to a piece and press (enter or space) to select it, thenmove your cursor to a tile you want to move and press (enter or space) to jump or clone your piece to that position.

The game ends when no more moves are possible. The player with the most hexagons on the board wins.

Enjoy the game and have fun strategizing to defeat your opponent!
